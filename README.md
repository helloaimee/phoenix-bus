# :oncoming_bus: Phoenix Real Time Bus Tracker

## :two_hearts: Description

This is a real time map of all buses currently in transit in Phoenix, AZ. Their locations refresh every 15 seconds, and a color scale indicates the speed of each bus. 

## :question: How to run

A live version can be viewed at https://helloaimee.github.io/phoenix-bus. 

To view and develop locally, you will need your own Mapbox account and access token. After saving the files to a folder on your local machine, edit the mapanimation.js file to change the mapboxgl.accessToken variable to your personal token from your account. 

## :clock9: Roadmap of future improvements

- [x] Change city from Boston to Phoenix
